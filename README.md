# AI-Virtual-Mouse


Project Title: AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures
Overview
The AI Virtual Mouse project is an innovative system designed to control a computer using hand gestures, eliminating the need for physical contact with the mouse or keyboard. By leveraging a webcam, computer vision techniques, and AI-based gesture recognition, the virtual mouse can interpret various hand movements to perform actions like left click, right click, dragging, zooming in and out, and adjusting the system volume.

This system combines OpenCV for image capture and processing, MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse and keyboard events. The goal is to create a hands-free interface that enhances user experience, accessibility, and convenience across different platforms and devices.

Need for the Project
Touchless Interaction:

In a world increasingly oriented towards hygiene and non-contact solutions, a virtual mouse allows for interaction without touching physical devices. This is especially important in shared or public environments.
Accessibility:

Individuals with physical disabilities may find traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard challenging to use. This system provides an alternative interface, enabling hands-free control through natural hand gestures, improving accessibility for a wider range of users.
Innovation in Human-Computer Interaction:

As technology advances, the demand for intuitive, gesture-based interfaces is growing. From virtual reality (VR) to augmented reality (AR), gesture recognition is becoming a key method of interaction. This project lays the groundwork for future AI-driven, gesture-controlled applications.
Gaming and Entertainment:

Gesture-based control can enhance the gaming and entertainment experience by making interactions more immersive and intuitive, eliminating the need for traditional controllers.
Future Integration with Smart Devices:

With the rise of smart homes, IoT (Internet of Things), and AI, gesture-based control could be seamlessly integrated with smart TVs, lights, and other appliances, further streamlining user experiences in modern smart environments.
